# HW5-DayPlanner


Purpose
The purpose of this project was to create a working day planner
that stores user input locally.

Tasks Completed
I created three columns, one to provide the hours of the day,
another as a place for the user to submit events, and the last
as a place to store the save button. The save button is used to 
the user data in local storage.


Closing
The Day Planner was built using Javascript strictly. In no way did i 
change the provided source HTML and CSS files.
